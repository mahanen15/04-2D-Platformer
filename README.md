The player sprite is an adaptation of [MV Platformer Male](https://opengameart.org/content/mv-platformer-male-32x64) by MoikMellah. CC0 Licensed.

The bat sprite was originally created by bagzie for Stendhal and was [reworked by AntumDeluge](https://opengameart.org/content/bat-rework). 

The pathfinding code was adapted from the good work done by FEDEOD: [https://github.com/FEDE0D/godot-pathfinding2d-demo](https://github.com/FEDE0D/godot-pathfinding2d-demo). Special thanks goes to GDQuest for their excellent pathfinding tutorial: [https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/2d/navigation2d-tilemap-pathfinding/](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/2d/navigation2d-tilemap-pathfinding/).
